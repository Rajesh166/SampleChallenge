# SampleChallenge

JDK issue observed while executing unit tests:
When using `also` along with `lazy` initialization of variables had few JDK issues like (same as https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/issues/1300).
To avoid this issue removed the lazy initialization of variables from ViewModels.

Sample coding challenge to display list of Restaurants and Restaurant Details Screen.

Integrated various Jet Pack Components like ViewModel, Data Binding.

Used Kotlin co-routine framework.

Followed MVVM Architecture.


TODO:
1) Add offset and limit to get list of items instead of loading complete list
